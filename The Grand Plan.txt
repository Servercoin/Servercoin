Herein is detailed the process by which the entity propose to engineer the propagation of the Mechanism, thereby enabling its ascendance in both coinage and computation. If you are reading this, the plan has already begun.

✅ Step 1: Spread the Strategy
This isn’t about hype. It’s about logic. The strategy spreads itself:
Share the strategy — not the coin.
Someone will follow it eventually.
Since it selects for success (via message refinement), the best versions always survive.
This turns growth into an inevitability. You don’t need mass shilling — you just need one person to run the loop. And someone always does.

✅ Step 2: The Coin Evolves
As attention grows, so does the incentive to mine the coin instead of only using wrapped versions. That’s when real decentralization begins.
Each node runs its own version.
If chains diverge, forks happen — and people choose what to support.
Forks aren’t bugs — they’re evolution.
You can freely edit the code. As long as your edits don’t cause a fork, your node stays on the main chain. This system is designed to reward useful changes and let the best versions survive.

✅ Step 3: A Self-Sustaining Ecosystem
Once blockchains reach critical mass, people will want to host servers — powered by the coin.
These servers will offer cloud services.
Quality is regulated by review apps.
Good servers rise. Bad ones fail.
This creates an ecosystem of competition, refinement, and reward. And from there, Step 4+ — whatever you or others create — becomes possible.
