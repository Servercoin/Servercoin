Servercoin

How it works
It works by making it so anyone can set up a Servercoin server, and all the Servercoin servers are listed on the other servers. These servers are all connected to each other. You buy things on these servers with Servercoins. Leaving the server on for longer gives a higher chance of getting the block reward but there is a chance of a server with less wait time getting the block reward, this is so that people aren’t discouraged as if only the one with the highest time could get the reward, that would mean that as long as that server’s left on, no one else can get the reward.

Why it was made
Servercoin was made because I realized that just 2 companies control 56% of the market share of the cloud server market.
So I decided to make this to fix that problem.

Well what about if someone’s server has poor customer service?
You can check their ratings on a Servercoinguard node.If someone’s server has poor customer service you should rate the server on a Servercoinguard node.

What if that Servercoinguard app has poor customer service?
Then you should use another one, anyone can make a Servercoinguard app so if your ratings are getting deleted by the app you can use another, there’s no way someone could censor all of them.
